* Inheritance:
1. A relationship between classes.
2. For "Don't repeat yourself" principle(Don't need to create same properties)
3. Only using related classes like having same behaviours


-> The Employee class inherits from the Person class and so it automatically acquires all the public members of the Person class

->  C# does not allow a class to inherit multiple classes. A class can only achieve multiple inheritances through interfaces
